# Ziziphus Microsatellite (SSR DB)

This is an advanced, modern, and responsive web application for displaying SSR marker data for two jujube species:

- **Ziziphus mauritiana** (Indian jujube)
- **Ziziphus jujuba** (Chinese jujube)

The site is built using [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and layout, and PapaParse to load CSV data directly into the browser.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Modern and fancy layout using Bootstrap 5.
- **Data Loading:** Loads marker data from CSV files using PapaParse.
- **Interactive Search:** In-page search to filter marker records in real time.
- **Species Switch:** Dropdown to switch between species data.
- **Easy Hosting:** Designed for static hosting on GitHub Pages.

## How to Host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push all files with the structure shown above.
2. Go to the repository's **Settings**.
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
4. Under **Source**, select the branch (e.g., `main`) and the root folder.
5. Click **Save**. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

## Usage

- **Select Species:** Choose the species from the dropdown menu.
- **Search Markers:** Type in the search box to filter markers by any field (Marker ID, Repeat Sequence, Primer sequences, or Annealing Temp).
